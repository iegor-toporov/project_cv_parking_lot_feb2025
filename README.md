# project_cv_parking_lot_feb2025

This project aims to build a computer vision system that can:
- detect parking spots and classify them into occupied or not
- detect cars
- classify the parked cars into properly parked or not
- segment the cars
- create a minimap of detected spots and cars \n
Images datased used: https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/parking-lot-database/
These are the only images that were used to develop the system.
