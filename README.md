# project_cv_parking_lot_feb2025

This project aims to build a computer vision system that uses only OpenCV and that can:
- detect parking spots and classify them into occupied or not
- detect cars
- classify the parked cars into properly parked or not
- segment the cars
- create a minimap of detected spots and cars.

In order to run it, compile the main. Keep in mind that in order to use images you have to download the folder from the website and change the path to the image inside the main. You will need OpenCV installed on your pc.

Images datased used: https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/parking-lot-database/
These are the only images that were used to develop the system.
